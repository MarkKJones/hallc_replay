0) Add average drift time distributions per plane to root file 
   
    - get_hdc_time_histo.C : reads ROOTfiles/test_xx.root and
                             loops over all entries to fill
                             drift time histos and writes them
                             to hms_dc_time_xx.root

    FOR NEXT STEP, GO TO 'wire_drift_time' directory

... After step (3)...

4) Add the "t0" correction to the drift time spectra obtained in step (0)
   using the following script:
 
     -get_hdc_time_histo_tzero_corrected.C

    This scipt fills the drift time histos directly from the root file
    test_xx.root and adds the weighted "t0" values to each plane. The
    t0-corrected histos are saved in the same root file produced in step(0).
   
    The t0 correction can be seen visually by superimposing the drift time 
    from all twelve planes before and after applying the correction. The
    before and after correction histos should be drawn in different colors
    in order to actually see the correction effect.
