5) Create a lookup table (hdriftmap.param) of values for each plane
   based on integratig the "t0" corrected drift time spectra for each
   plane.

   HOW ARE THE LOOKUP VALUES CALCULATED FOR EACH PLANE?
   
   Each drift time corresponds to a drift distance. The lookup values
   are conversion factors between the two quantities. The lookup values
   are calculated on a bin-by-bin basis from the "t0"-corrected drift distance
   spectra. For each bin in the drift time spectra, starting from the bin
   corresponding to "t0" (0 ns), up to a certain maximum bin, 

    lookup value [ith bin] = ith bin Content / total bin content 

   where the total bin content is the sum of all bin contents from
   t0_bin to maximum bin. 

To produce the lookup table, on the terminal run ... 

    >> root -l get_LookUp_Values.C   
   
     OUTPUT FILE: ../../PARAM/HMS/DC/hdriftmap.param

6) Run the hallc_replay script on the raw data file.

After updating the hdc.param (ster 3) and the hdriftmap.param (step 5)
files, run the hallc_replay script on the test_xx.dat file again to
produce an updated root file.

***IMPORTANT: Make sure to change the name of the output root file in
the hallc_replay script so that it does nor overwrite the previous root
file, and be able to compare histograms from both.
