1) Get individual sense wire drift time distribution per plane

   - MakeClass() was used on ROOTfiles/test_xx.root to produce the files:
             wire_drift_times.C 
             wire_drift_times.h
    These files will serve as a skeleton for further analysis
    The wire_drift_times.C is executed as follows:
        On terminal type:              
               >> root -l
               >> .L wire_drift_times.C
               >> wire_drift_times t
               >> t.Loop()
     The code will prompt the user to enter the run number, which chamber and
     plane to loop over all entries for individual sense wires. Once done, 
     from this directory, change to directory mentioned below ...

     OUTPUT ROOT FILE : root_files/run_259/hms_DC_1x1_259.root    //example  
     The root file will contain saved individual sense wire drift time
     histos for the given plane, and a 2D histo: sense_wires vs. drift_time
     

2) Extract the "t0" value on a wire-by-wire basis, calculate
   the "t0" weighted average and assign it to the plane in question
     
     WHAT IS "t0"? 
     The "t0" is defined as the time corresponding to when the ionized
     charged particle has drifted and is in contact with the sense wire.
     The "t0" corresponds to the physical location in the histo where the
     particle comes in contact with the wire. If its value is anything other
     than zero nanoseconds (0 ns), it is interpreted as the value by which the
     drift time must be shifted in order to align the "t0" with 0 ns. For example,
     if t0 = -3 ns, the drift time histo must be shifted by +3 ns. These "t0" are small 
     corrections that must be applied to each plane. All later times in each drift time spectra 
     are measured relative to this time, for each plane. 
  
     HOW TO CALCULATE "t0"? 
     The "t0" for each plane is determined by calculating the "t0" for individual wires
     in each plane and taking a weighted average. The "t0" for individual sense wires
     is determined by doing a linear fit at around 20%(Peak) +/- #bins for each sense wire
     drift time histo.The number of bins in which to include the fit is left to the user to 
     decide based on the characteristics of each wire drift time. The linear fit is then
     extrapolated to the horizontal axis (drift time), and this extrapolated value is called "t0".
     For the X,X', U, and V planes, cosmic flux is position-dependent, so the upper region of the
     drift chamber have lower cosmic acceptacne(more cosmics coming normal to the ground that at an angle), 
     leading to smaller number of events. This would cause a degradation in the quality of the fit 
     in some wires, since not enough events are accumulated, and would lead to an inaccurate representation 
     of the physics taking place in the chambers. To overcome this problem, we required the total number of
     events to exceed 300 (>300 events) per wire, and took the weighted average of the "t0" values that met
     this condition. 
     
     The following code uses the OUTPUT ROOT FILE mentioned in step (1) to calculate "t0" on a wire basis: 
     Typing on the terminal
                 >> root -l get_wire_tzero.C
     will prompt the user to enter run number, DC 1 or 2, and plane. The user must enter the planes in the
     following order: 1x1, 1y1, 1u1, 1v1, 1y2, 1x2, 2x1, 2y1, 2u1, 2v1, 2y2, 2x2, so these values may be added 
     to the parameter files later on the analysis in this order. For each plane (say 1x1), the code will produce 
     the following output files:

     OUTPUT FILES: tzero_data/hdc_1x1tzero_run259.txt 
                   CONTENT: calculated "t0" and its error per wire for all 
                            wires in a plane.
                  
                   root_files/run_259/hmsDC_1x1run259_saved_histos.root
                   CONTENT: fitted drift time spectra per wire and  two "t0"
                            vs wire plots: one for all wires, and the other 
                            for wires only exceeding 300 entries.

                   tzero_data/hdc_1x1tzero_run259_updated.txt
                   CONTENT: calculated "t0" and its error for wires
                            exceeding 300 entries.                   

                   tzero_data/tzero_weighted_avg_run259.txt
                   CONTENT: calculated "t0" weighted average for
                            the plane in question.

3) Add the weighted "t0" values to the LINE 'hdc_plane_time_zero = '  in the
   hdc.param file

           The following code updates the hdc.param file and creates
           a tzero.dat file without the commented lines:
                    >> root -l update_hdcparam.C
           
      OUTPUT FILES: ../../PARAM/HMS/DC/hdc.param
                   CONTENT: parameter file with added "t0" correction

                   ../hms_dc_t_Zero/tzero.dat
                   CONTENT: data file containing weighted average "t0"
                   without the comment lines found in tzero_weighted_avg_run259.txt


For the next step, go to ...
      >> ../hms_dc_t_Zero 
                and open the README file ....
